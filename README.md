## Introduction

Magnifix aims to create a space where freelancers and employers can interact and collaborate without intermediaries. Traditionally, gig economy platforms require the involvement of intermediaries who charge fees for facilitating transactions and ensuring transaction security. However, Magnifix leverages blockchain principles and smart contracts to eliminate the need for intermediaries.

On the Magnifix platform, tokens are used as a means of payment for services. Freelancers can set their prices in tokens, and employers can use tokens to pay for services. This provides transparency and efficiency in the payment process.

Tokens also play a role in dispute resolution. In case of a conflict between a freelancer and an employer, the parties can refer to a smart contract that defines dispute resolution rules. Tokens can be used as a deposit that is awarded to the party that prevails in the dispute.

Transaction security is also ensured through the use of blockchain technology. The blockchain records all transactions and contracts, making them immutable and transparent to all participants on the platform. This increases trust between freelancers and employers, eliminating the possibility of fraud or unethical behavior.
